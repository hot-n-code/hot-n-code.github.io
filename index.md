## GHG Tracker
### Overview
![ci-badge](https://github.com/hot-n-code/ghg-tracker/workflows/hot-n-code-ghg-tracker/badge.svg)

See our project here: [Project Repository](https://github.com/hot-n-code/ghg-tracker)

GHG Tracker is a web application designed to track the carbon footprint that residents of Hawai’i produce and reduce. Our focus is on Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) and how it is everyone’s responsibility. This web app focuses on tackling GHG from Transportation. Climate change has the potential to increase the severity and frequency of hurricanes, flooding, and droughts, and is expected to lead to increasing sea level rise. GHG is the most significant factor in climate change.

This app allows users to update their daily mode of transportation and track the effect of each time they use a mode of transportation. The user will have a custom profile by adding their cars, alternative modes of transportation (bike, walk, bus, etc.), personal goals, and a history of their data. By using real data from all models and makes of cars, as the user continues to use the app, it will update and calculate the total amount of carbon produced, reduced, fuel saved and total miles traveled.

# The Team:
Hot-n-Code is a team of passionate and hard-working undergraduate students from the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. They were grouped together for a class (ICS 414: Software Engineering II), by their professor, Dr. Cameron Moore. Since then, they have been working as a team to develop the GHG-Tracker project for [Hawaiian Electric Industries](http://www.hei.com/).

# Screenshots

Presented below is a walkthrough of the pages of our application. 

## Landing Page

Upon entering the site, the user is greeted by the landing page. This gives the user an overview of what the application is, information regarding greenhouse gases, 
and the importance of reducing our emissions through videos, news updates and a visual depicting the carbon saved to date.

## User Pages - My Data and My Vehicles

### See a breakdown of your GHG numbers by month

Upon logging in, users are greeted by their data page: an overall breakdown over their GHG emissions for the month. The page includes a profile card with the 
user's  name and goal, as well as an option to edit their profile, use the what if calculator, or view their transportation history. Users are also able to see a 
breakdown of their GHG emissions by seeing what mode of transportation they use the most via the mileage breakdown, as well as how much CO2 they produce and 
reduce, the number of alternative transportation miles they've traveled, and for the time being, the days they've worked at home.

Edit your goal, name or profile picture:
<img class="ui medium floated rounded image" src="/images/EditMyProfile.png" length="800" width="1000">


### My Transportation History

Users are able to view their all time transportation history. Displayed before them is the date of their trip, the mode of transportation, miles traveled, and the 
amount of CO2 reduced and produced for that trip. Similarly, users can add, edit, and delete their trip entries, as well as perform a what if calculation to 
encourage them to pursue a form of alternative transportation.

### What If

Not convinced of the benefits of alternative transportation? The what if function allows users to calculate their GHG numbers before they make their trip. Users
can input their planned travel details by inputting a mode of transportation as well as the distance traveled for their trip.

What if with a user's gas vehicle:

### Compare your data against the HEI Community!

Want to see where you stand in comparison to the HEI community? The application allows you to compare your CO2 produced and reduced against the average calculated 
from the HEI community for the current month. Similarly, a message is displayed to the user to either commend their efforts if their CO2 reduced is greater than 
the amount of CO2 that they have produced, or encourage them to consider their transportation choices if it is the other way around. 
<img class="ui medium floated rounded image" src="/images/ComparisonPt1.png" length="800" width="1000">

Regardless of one's CO2 efforts, the page also offers users modes of alternative transportation available to them across the state.
<img class="ui medium floated rounded image" src="/images/ComparisonPt2.png" length="800" width="1000">

### My Vehicles

Users can view the vehicles that they own as well as a short summary of their vehicle. 
<img class="ui medium floated rounded image" src="/images/MyVehicles.png" length="800" width="1000">

Users may also add their vehicles to their account to be factored into their travel data by searching through the various makes for their vehicle. 
<img class="ui medium floated rounded image" src="/images/CreateVehicle.png" length="800" width="1000">

## Cumulative Data

Users may view the cumulative data of the HEI community. They are able to view the number of users that use a certain form of transportation:
<img class="ui medium floated rounded image" src="/images/CumulativePt1.png" length="800" width="1000">

As well as a breakdown of the community's CO2 produced, reduced, vehicle miles traveled, and gallons of gas saved:
